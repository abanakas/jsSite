    <h1>I'm learning javascript!</h1>
    <p>On this site, and the pages within, I will be self-teaching myself javascript</p>
    <p>Years ago I atteneded Baker College online and persued a degree in Web Design.  One of the classes I had to take was a javascript class.  Back then javascript was used primarly to make all the annyoing, flashing, tacky websites of the early 2000's.  I didn't really like it, so I didn't keep up with it.  Years later, it's now become the thing that all sites are using along with every other technology that has been created.</p>
    <p>In between now and the time I recieved my Associates in Web Design, I have primarly worked with WordPress as it would allow me to get up and running without much work.  With all the templates and add-ons available, it was and still is one of the quickest ways to put yourself on the internet.  But with my limited knowledge of development, I would only edit the code that was handed to me.  Now's a good time to try and learn some new things and find out what I'm capable of doing with different technology.</p>
    <p>I'm going to take this space to re-familarize myself with the js technology along with other technology found in today's websites.</p>
    <h3>Today's Date</h3>
    <script src="Scripts/dateToday.js"></script>
    <p>To you, the reader, the date may not be that important to you.  Unless, of course, you didn't know what today's date was.  But, this is my first javascript code that I've written in a very long time.</p>
    <p>This is also the first website that I've handwritten in that same amount of time.</p>
